Below are two clean, professional rewrites—one using SandOS and one using Santos—along with an optional Web3/decentralized tone version for added flavor. You can choose the naming that best suits your branding.


---

For SandOS

SandOS.dev
This is the source repository for sandos.github.io and its custom domain sandos.dev. The legacy domain sandos.org now redirects to sandos.dev, and sandos.com is currently mirrored from the repository sandos/sandos.com pending full redirection to sandos.dev.

For Santos

Santos.dev
This is the source repository for santos.github.io and its custom domain santos.dev. The legacy domain santos.org now redirects to santos.dev, and santos.com is currently mirrored from the repository santos/santos.com pending full redirection to santos.dev.

Optional Add-On: Web3/Decentralized Tone

SandOS.dev
The decentralized repository powering the sandos.dev domain, designed for edge-native execution and virtual sandboxing. The legacy domain sandos.org now redirects to sandos.dev. While full propagation is underway, sandos.com mirrors content from sandos/sandos.com to maintain a seamless user experience.
